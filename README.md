# Diff-Pitcher (PyTorch)

Official Pytorch Implementation of [Diff-Pitcher](https://engineering.jhu.edu/lcap/data/uploads/pdfs/waspaa2023_hai.pdf): Diffusion-based Singing Voice Pitch Correction

ðŸ¤— Download model form [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/Higobeatz/Diff-Pitcher)

ðŸŽµ Listen to [examples](https://jhu-lcap.github.io/Diff-Pitcher/)

--------------------

Thank you all for your interest in this research project. I am currently optimizing the model's performance and computation efficiency. 

A new version of Diff-Pitcher is in development and will feature a user-friendly Hugging Face space.
